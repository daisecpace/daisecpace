**PAGE Module 1:  Identify Machine Generated Domain Names**

The purpose of detecting algorithmically generated domain names is to discover whether the domain names are potentially generated by malware or not. Domain names are series of text strings consisted of alphabets, numbers and dash signs. Thus, classification in machine learning would help in DGA domains detection. In this tutorial, we will provide sample data sets and programs for analyzing the domain name data. The tutorial aims to be an introduction to manipulate and analyze domain name data and then classify domain names into legitimate domains and DGA domains using supervised machine learning classifiers such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest.

**PAGE Module2:  Image Manipulation Detection**

With the increasing popularity of image manipulation from memes creation to image filters apps, there was a concern in the malicious use of such applications. Digitally forged images have been used to target opposing politicians, support or depreciate public manifestations, spread hoaxes, and et. cetera.
Studies like this article (https://cognitiveresearchjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41235-017-0067-2) have shown that people are not good at detecting manipulated images. In this tutorial, we will see how to train deep learning models to spot manipulated images.
The images contained in the dataset are separated into two categories: manipulated and non-manipulated images.
