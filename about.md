Our project DAISEC (Data Analytics In cyberSECurity) aims to incorporate hands-on teaching of data analytics in cybersecurity. To that end, we create three hands-on teaching modules that incorporates authentic analytics based solutions for cybersecurity related problems.
We hope to these hands-on materials: 

•	Help the cybersecurity community to train a new generation of cyber security professionals who would understand and be able to implement data analytics in cybersecurity problems;  

•	Enrich the current cybersecurity curriculum to attract students studying in computing, 

•	Introduce cybersecurity as a new knowledge area for Information Systems students for future career choices, and 

•	Bridge the gap between the current curriculum and industry expectations by introducing an emerging knowledge area. 
Please go to modules section to access materials for each module.
