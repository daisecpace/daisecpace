# Data AnalytIcs for cyberSEC

This project aims to address “Integration of hand-on learning experiences into cyber security curriculum” as described in Section 1.2.1 of the solicitation. Development of teaching modules will involve data collection and calibration of relevant datasets; and development of teaching materials such as use-cases and project evaluation rubrics. We created three modules. These modules are disseminated via a public domain website. In addition, in accordance with our plan, we created a two-server system that is capable of hosting multi-session environments for data analytics projects and data collections
